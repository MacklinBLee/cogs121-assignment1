Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status
When the user presses the submit button we included a message letting them know the information is recorded
 
2. Match between system and the real world
We included a logout button in the top right corner, just as it appears in many other applications
 
3. User control and freedom
To give the user control in case they scroll too far to the bottom reading comments, we included a “scroll to the top button” as a fast way to get back to the top to make a comment of their own

4. Consistency and standards
We kept the style on the login page the same as the home page for consistency. We wanted it to be clear two pages were from the same application
 
5. Error prevention
We include a text explaining that every field is required
 
6. Recognition rather than recall
We left the ability to comment right under the photo so the user does not need to scroll to the top to remember what the photo looks like before commenting. They can look at the picture while commenting
 
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
For the experienced user we made it so the user could submit a comment by either clicking on the submit button or by simply pressing “enter”
 
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
We kept the information clean and relevant without redundant information
 
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
We give an error if the user does not fill out all the required fields and tell them which field is not filled
 
10. Help and documentation
We designed our application to be simple and straightforward so that documentation would not be required. We believe additional help/documentation would hinder our minimalistic design
