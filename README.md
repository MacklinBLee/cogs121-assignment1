Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status
	When the user presses the submit button and/or presses enter they will see their message show up immediately above the in the chatbox, showing that it was successfully submitted. Having the new message appear close to the message submission box also helps the user see it faster in terms of closeness in the Gestalt principles. 
 
2. Match between system and the real world
	We inverted the original chat format so that the newest messages appear at the bottom of the chatbox like  in most chat rooms that exist such as facebook messenger. We also included a logout button in the top right corner, just as it appears in many other applications so it meets user expectations.
 
3. User control and freedom
	Regardless of where the scroll bar is for the chat window when the user sends a message it automatically goes to the bottom to the most updated portion of the chat. 

4. Consistency and standards
	We kept the colors from the login page the same as the colors for the home page. We wanted to make sure the login page looked like the same application as the home page. 
 
5. Error prevention
	We include a text explaining that a message is required before hitting enter to send a message
 
6. Recognition rather than recall
	We kept the main functionality all on one page with tabs so the user doesn't need to scroll down to find the game. All the tabs are labelled so the user does not need to remember what the purpose of each tab is. 
 
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
	For the experienced user we made it so the user could submit a comment by either clicking on the submit button or by simply pressing “enter”
 
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
	We kept the information clean and relevant without redundant information
 
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
	We give an error if the user does not fill out all the required fields and tell them which field is not filled
 
10. Help and documentation
	We included a home tab as an introduction before the user clicks a game. This includes a  brief introduction of the site's purpose and an intro to how to play the game, we designed our application to be simple and straightforward so that not much documentation would be needed.
